-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization, person, program, technology, funding, project, initiative, coalition, policy, energy, environmental management]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity

Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in The primary language of the provided text is **English**. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter. If you have to translate, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

 emissaries to a celestial congress we're only beginning to comprehend," Jordan's voice was somber, resonating with a mix of trepidation and honor. 

The room filled with the resonance of human and alien minds converging, creating a new narrative within the fathomless expanse of existence. Paranormal Military Squad, once protectors of Earth's clandestine secrets, had now become the tether linking humanity to the cosmic fold.

The underground command center of Dulce Base, once pulsing with covert operations, now resonated with the charge of an impending cosmic threshold. Encircled by banks of whirring machinery, each monitor flickered erratically with alien script that had occupied center stage in the lives of Alex Mercer, Jordan Hayes, Taylor Cruz, and Sam Rivera.

Jordan's gaze didnâ€™t flit for even a moment from the screens, where indiscernible alien messages ebbed and flowed like the tide. The ciphers and symbols cascaded down as they
