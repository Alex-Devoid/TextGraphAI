THE GENTLEMAN IS RECOGNIZED THANK YOU, MR. SPEAKER, I RISE IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 5863, THE FEDERAL DISASTER TAX RELIEF ACT. INTRODUCED BY MY WAYS AND MEANS COLLEAGUE FROM BEL STEUBE. THIS LEGISLATION WAS APPROVED LAST YEAR BY THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE 38-0 BECAUSE FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO SUFFERED DISASTERS NEED SUPPORT. IN FACT, BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THIS LEGISLATION WAS SO STRONG THAT IT WAS APPROVED A SECOND TIME BY THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE AS PART OF THE TAX RELIEF FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES AND WORKERS ACT. THIS LEGISLATION NOT ONLY HELPS VICTIMS OF DISASTERS BUT PROVIDES BROAD AND IMMEDIATE TAX RELIEF FOR AMERICAN WORKERS, FARMERS, FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES, WHICH IS WHY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PASSED IT WITH 84% SUPPORT EARLIER THIS YEAR. I ENCOURAGE MY SENATE COLLEAGUES TO TAKE UP THAT LEGISLATION TO SUPPORT DISASTER VICTIMS AND HELP THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TREADING WATER IN TODAY'S ECONOMY. THE FEDERAL DISASTER TAX RELIEF ACT PROVIDES ASSISTANCE TO COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY BRINGING RELIEF TO THOSE RECOVERING AND REBUILDING AFTER TRAGIC FLOODS AND TORNADOES LIKE THOSE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES IN MY HOME STATE OF MISSOURI IN THE WINTER OF 2021 AND SUMMER OF 2023. HURRICANES LIKE HURRICANE IAN THAT CLAIMED COUNTLESS LIVES IN FLORIDA, WILDFIRES THAT DEVASTATED COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND HAWAII AND THE TRAIN DERAILMENT AND TOXIC IN EAST PALESTINE, OHIO. I WANT TO COMMEND REPRESENTATIVE STEUBE FOR HIS LEADERSHIP. HIS PASSION STARTED WITH HIS DESIRE TO PROVIDE HELP TO THE FAMILIES HE REPRESENTS WHO WERE DEVASTATED BY THE HURRICANE. BUT IN THE INTEREST OF GETTING THIS DONE, HE BROADEND HIS RELIEF EFFORT TO INCLUDE OVER 300 STORMS IN 45 STATES. I ENCOURAGE ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES TO VOTE YES ON THIS BILL SO WE ARE STANDING WITH AND SUPPORTING OUR FELLOW NEIGHBORS WHEN THEY ARE MOST IN NEED. I RESERVE. ...

SUCH TIME AS I MAY CONSUME. JARNGD. I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION AND I THANK CHAIRMAN SMITH OF THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE FOR ALL OF THE GOOD WORK HE HAS DONE TO ENSURE WE ARE ABLE TO HELP OUR CONSTITUENTS WHO ARE SUFFERING AS A RESULT OF NATURAL DISASTERS AND COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND, MR. STEUBE WHO WITHOUT HIS LEADERSHIP ON THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE, WE WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY. AND ALSO, MR. LAMALFA, MY COLLEAGUE TO THE NORTH OF MY DISTRICT 2HO 2AS WORKED WITH ME OVER THE YEARS TO ADDRESS ONE COMPONENT THAT IS COVERED BY THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. THIS HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING FOR MY CONSTITUENTS, TOO LONG, WAY TOO LONG. NOW THE SECOND TIME IN FIVE MONTHS THAT THIS HOUSE HAS COME TOGETHER TO STATE PLAINLY AND IN BIPARTISAN FASHION THAT AMERICANS SHOULD HELP ONE ANOTHER WHEN DISASTER STRIKES. WHILE THE SENATE CONTINUES TO PLAY POLITICS WIT H WHAT OUG HT TO BE A BIPARTISAN VICTORY, THEY HAVE BEEN SITTING ON THE TAX BILL FOR FIVE MONTHS. AND I JOIN CHAIRMAN SMITH IN CALLING FOR THEM TO MOVE THE ENTIRE BIL L, BEC AUSE THERE IS SO MUCH IN THAT FOR SO MANY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND I JUST WANT TO BRIEFLY REITERATE HOW WE GOT HERE TODAY. IN MY DISTRICT, WILDFIRES IN 2015, 2017 AND 2018 DEVASTATED ENTIRE COMMUNITIES ACROSS MY DISTRICT AND ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ENTIRE TOWNS WERE DESTROYED. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LOST HOMES. DOZENS OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES. IN THE AFTERMATH, THE COURTS FOUND THAT PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC WAS LIABLE FOR CAUSING SOME OF THESE FIRES. AS PART OF ITS SUBSEQUENT BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS, THE UTILITY ESTABLISHED A TRUST FROM FIRE SURVIVORS ARE GENERALLY ELIGIBLE FOR COMPENSATION FOR LOSSES SUSTAINED DURING THESE FIRES. LET ME PAUSE HERE TO SAY ONE THING. NO DISASTER SURVIVOR IS EVER MADE WHOLE. NO ONE IS EVER MADE WHOLE. PEOPLE LOST THEIR HOMES AND EVERYTHING IN THEIR HOMES. FAMILY PICTURES, FAMILY RECORDS. THEY LOST BU SINESSES AND AS I SAID EARLIER, SADLY THEY LOST FAMILY MEMBERS. AND WHILE THE COURTS EVENTUALLY CREATED A PATH TO COMPENSATION, IT TOOK YEARS TO GET THERE, YEARS MY CONSTITUENTS DIDN'T HAVE. THEY COULDN'T WAIT AROUND FOR THREE, FO UR, SIX YEARS TO GE T A PAYMENT FROM THAT TRUST AND THEN BECAUSE THE TRUST WAS STRUCTURED IN THE FORM OF STOCK SHARES AND BECAUSE STOCK SHA RES NEED TO BEMON ADVERTISED CAREFULLY AND SLOWLY IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE RETURNS TO SURVIVORS, THE PAYMENTS TO SURVIVORS CAME IN BATCHES. NOBODY IS GETTING, REPEAT, NOBODY IS GETTING 100% OF WHAT THEY LOST. AND THEN TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, RIDERS OUR CONSTITUENTS STARTED TO GET EVEN A LITTLE BIT OF COMPENSATION, OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE TOLD THEY MAY OWE TAXES ON THESE PAYMENTS BECAUSE DEPENDING ON THE TAXPAYER, THE PAYMENTS MAY QUALIFY AS INCOME. IN FOUR YEARS OF WORKING ON THIS ISSUE, I HA VE YET TO EN COUNTER A SINGLE PER SON ON EIT HER SIDE OF THE AISLE WHO BELIEVES THIS IS FAIR. THAT'S WHY WE HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL IN PASSING THIS LEGISLATION NUMEROUS TIMES OUT OF THE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE AND OFF THE FLOOR OF THIS HOU SE. THIS BILL HAS BEEN STA LLED, ADV ANCED AND THEN HEL D UP. IT HAS BEEN MAR KED UP AND PAS SED THE HOUSE AND STALLED AGA IN.

MY NEIG HBORS IN SANTA ROSA AREA, AND OF COURSE MY GOOD FRIEND, MS. T OKUDA IN LAHAINA, WHO SUFFERED EVEN MORE GREATLY LOSS OF LIFE THAN WHAT OUR S HAD BEEN, A RECORD IN P ARADISE. WE DON'T WANT TO SET RECORDS, WE WANT TO GET R ESULTS. IT'S BEEN A G REAT PARTNERSHIP ON TOP OF DISAST ER AND HEART ACH E. SO JUST PICTU RE THIS, THOUGH. AS I TALK ABO UT PARADISE. YOU WAKE UP IN 2HE 2ORNING, YOU HEAR THERE'S FIRE. ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S AN EVACUATION. PEOPLE ARE CROWDING THE NARROW ROADWAYS TRYING TO GET UP THE HILL OR DOWN THE HILL, OUT OF TOWN. BARELY MAKING IT IN SOME CASES. SCORCHED VEHICLES. TIRES ON FIRE. ALL THAT. THEY'RE SEEING IN THEIR REAR-VIEW MIRROR THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS ENGULFED IN FLAMES, THEIR HOUSES GOING DOWN, ALL THEIR MOW ALL THEIR M MOMENTOS ARE IN THE. THEY'RE WONDERING, DID THEIR NEIGHBOR GET OUT?

THE RESILIENCE OF THESE FOLKS IN THE FIRES THAT I'VE HAD IN MY DISTRICT, NEIGHBORS AND OTHER NEIGHBORING STATES, IS JUST AMAZING. AS THEY'VE STUCK WITH US ON THIS. SO AS SETTLEMENT HAPPENED WITH THE UTILITY, SOMEHOW PARTLY COMPENSATE AND WON'T EVER BE MADE WHOLE, THEY CAN NEVER BE MADE WHOLE, EVEN WITH A LOT OF MONEY, THAT SETTLEMENT SHOULD NOT BE TAXABLE -- A TAXABLE EVENT. BREAK THAT DOWN FOR A MINUTE. YOU'RE IN YOUR HOME, YOU'VE BEEN PAYING OFF YOUR MORTGAGE, MAYBE IT'S ALREADY PAID OFF. YOU'VE GOT YUREK WHICH THE IN YOUR HOME -- YOUR EQUITY IN YOUR HOME. SO THIS DISASTER HAPPENS. YOU LOSE YOUR HOME. ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU'VE GOT TO REARRANGE YOUR LIFE, YOU HAVE TO REBUILD YOUR LIFE. THAT PORTION OF THAT EQUITY THAT NOW IS GOING TO BE COMPENSATED FOR PARTLY BY THE SETTLEMENT WITH THE UTILITY, THAT PORTION OF YOUR HOME IS NOW A NEWLY TAXABLE EVENT. BECAUSE OF THE I.R.S. INTERPRETATION ON THAT. HOW IS THAT RIGHT? HOW IS THAT FAIR AT ALL THAT YOU HAVE RIPPED OUT OF YOUR LIFE YOUR HOME, YOUR FAMILY, WHATEVER MAY HAVE HAPPENED TO YOU PERSONALLY, AND NO W YOU HAVE A TAXABLE EVENT ON TOP OF THAT PIECE OF EQUITY THAT WAS IN YOUR HOME BECAUSE OF A BAD INTERPRETATION HERE?

THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO EVERCOME THESE HURD -- OVERCOME THESE HURDLES WE HAVE TO GET THIS DONE. PEOPLE DESERVE TO HAVE THAT PREDICTABILITY, THAT SUSTAINABILITY OF THEIR LIFE, TO BE ABLE TO PUT IT BACK AND PUT THEMSELVES BACK INTO A GOOD WAY AGAIN.
