THIS LEGISLATION NOT ONLY HELPS VICTIMS OF DISASTERS BUT PROVIDES BROAD AND IMMEDIATE TAX RELIEF FOR AMERICAN WORKERS, FARMERS, FAMILIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES, WHICH IS WHY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES PASSED IT WITH 84% SUPPORT EARLIER THIS YEAR. I ENCOURAGE MY SENATE COLLEAGUES TO TAKE UP THAT LEGISLATION TO SUPPORT DISASTER VICTIMS AND HELP THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TREADING WATER IN TODAY'S ECONOMY. THE FEDERAL DISASTER\nOutput:"}
